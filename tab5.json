I use these in my home office running off a Denon 6300 as a second zone. I absolutely love them. These do have a front firing port which I wanted since my home office is small. 6.5” driver does a nice job with bass response and I have no issues with ear fatigue. I had some Klipsch RP-600M’s before those and I couldn’t listen more than an hour. \n\nRight now, Crutchfield has the newer version of the Bronze at $449 for the 50’s (5.5” driver) and $539 for the 100’s (8” driver) Unfortunately they are now all rear firing ports. \n\nI’ve never heard the Elacs so I can’t compare, but I have had Monitors for years - my 5.1 setup is over 20 years old and I still am surprised by how good they still sound. I’m probably biased just a bit lol",

I paid $200 USD, they were like new. I use these in my home office running off a Denon 6300 as a second zone. I absolutely love them. These do have a front firing port which I wanted since my home office is small. 6.5” driver does a nice job with bass response and I have no issues with ear fatigue. I had some Klipsch RP-600M’s before those and I couldn’t listen more than an hour. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003ERight now, Crutchfield has the newer version of the Bronze at $449 for the 50’s (5.5” driver) and $539 for the 100’s (8” driver) Unfortunately they are now all rear firing ports. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI’ve never heard the Elacs so I can’t compare, but I have had Monitors for years - my 5.1 setup is over 20 years old and I still am surprised by how good they still sound. I’m probably biased just a bit lol\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/div\u003E",
